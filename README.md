# stride_ml

stride_ml is a python package for building models on STRIDE data. 

There are four main features of this library
1. Process STRIDE into an efficient per-patient data format to enable further processing (done by stride_ml extractor)
2. Apply labeling functions on those patients to obtain labels
3. Apply featurization schemes on those patients to obtain a feature matrix
4. Train and evaluate models using using patient splitting and cross validation
