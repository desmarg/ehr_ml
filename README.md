# ehr_ml

ehr_ml is a python package for building models on EHR data. 

There are four main features of this library
1. Convert EHR and claims data into a common schema
2. Apply labeling functions on that schema in order to derive labels
3. Apply featurization schemes on those patients to obtain feature matrices
4. Perform many other common tasks necessary in order to perform research with EHR data

ehr_ml also contains an implementation of CLMBR (https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05295).
